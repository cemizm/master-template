A preview document containing examples for it's features
is located under [master-thesis.pdf]()

Some of the details and features provided by this template:
* KOMAScript class (scrartcl)
* Double sided layout
* living headers
* code formatting
* UML diagrams
    * textual description ([PlantUML](http://plantuml.com))
    * vector graphics
    * same font as in document
